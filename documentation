callbacks:
    sm.load():
        Runs only once after the window is created and everything's 
        ready to be used.

        Normally useful for loading things like textures or maps!

    sm.loop():
        Runs every single frame after the window is created and set-up,
        it cannot render anything into the screen and should only be used
        for processing logic, and not graphics.

    sm.draw():
        Runs every single frame after the window is created and set-up, and
        unlike sm.loop, this one is designed specifically for rendering and
        hopefully rendering-only!
